# CSC226 Final Project

**Author(s)**: Ayomide Oludairo
**Title**: `The Shrinking Moving Blocks Game`
**Objective**: `Two Moving Blocks are trapped in a border, one controlled by the user, the other as an NPC. When the 
blocks collide they shrink in size. The largest block at the end of the 5 minute timer is crowned the winner.`

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Source Assignment(s)**: `HW07, T12, T10, T05, T11`

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:

Ô∏è**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: oludairoa
    Branch 2 name: _____________
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    So far I have been working on creating the individual UserBlock and MovingBlock classes. I am working on first getting 
    them to load onto the screen. I have used several references such as the code for the game from teamwork eleven. 
    I plan to code a shrink method myself and manipulate the events of the game when the blocks collide. I feel like I'm
    where I should be, but I would like to figure things out sooner, rather than later. I am worried about possibly not 
    finishing in time, and if I will ask for help when needed. I feel like what I'm doing right now is easy, I just need 
    to use the references provided, and then enhance them and personalize them to the game that I am aiming to create.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

Ô∏è**Completion Percentage**: `55%`

Ô∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    I believe that I will be able to complete this project on time. Now that I have solved some of the errors, most of 
    what I have left to do is related to creating and implementing functions. Once that is done I can look back and add 
    any extra features I feel are necessary. While creating my project I focused more on the functions when I first started.
    Then I began trying to design an interface based on the functions. In other parts, (the shrinking), I needed to have an 
    already existing interface in order for me to know if what I coded would work correctly or not. I also have several 
    references, as well as similar teamwork assignments that do the tasks I want to do.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
